# Datasets for debug with GDB

Use this SConstruct template to fetch RSF files from directory to
directory dataset in order to be used in debug with GDB.

That workflow will avoid the need to generate dataset for debug with a
specific SConstruct. You can use the same dataset you use with your programs
during development.
